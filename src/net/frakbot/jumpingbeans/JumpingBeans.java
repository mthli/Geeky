/**
 * Provides "jumping beans" functionality for a TextView.
 * <p/>
 * Remember to call the {@link #stopJumping()} method once you're done
 * using the JumpingBeans (that is, when you detach the TextView from
 * the view tree, you hide it, or the parent Activity/Fragment goes in
 * the paused status). This will allow to release the animations and
 * free up memory and CPU that would be otherwise wasted.
 * <p/>
 * Please note that you:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Must not</b> try to change a jumping beans text in a textview before calling
 * {@link #stopJumping()} as to avoid unnecessary invalidation calls;
 * the JumpingBeans class cannot know when this happens and will keep
 * animating the textview (well, try to, anyway), wasting resources</li>
 * <li><b>Must not</b> try to use a jumping beans text in another view; it will not
 * animate. Just create another jumping beans animation for each new
 * view</li>
 * <li><b>Must not</b> use more than one JumpingBeans instance on a single TextView, as
 * the first cleanup operation called on any of these JumpingBeans will also cleanup
 * all other JumpingBeans' stuff. This is most likely not what you want to happen in
 * some cases.</li>
 * <li><b>Should not</b> use JumpingBeans on large chunks of text. Ideally this should
 * be done on small views with just a few words. We've strived to make it as inexpensive
 * as possible to use JumpingBeans but invalidating and possibly relayouting a large
 * TextView can be pretty expensive.</li>
